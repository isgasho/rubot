#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! An easily reusable game bot for deterministic games.
//!
//! It is required to implement the trait [`Game`][game] to use this crate.
//! For more details, look at the [trait documentation][game] or visit the [examples directory][ex].
//!
//! While this crate will probably have many different kind of bots in the future, there is currently only one: [`alpha_beta`][ab].
//!
//! This bot uses an optimized version of [alpha beta pruning][ab_wiki] with [iterative deepening][id].

///
/// Implementing this trait for `21 flags`. The game has the following rules:
///
/// - at the beginning there are 21 flags.
/// - 2 players draw 1, 2 or 3 flags in alternating turns
/// - the player who removes the last flag wins
///
/// This is example is really simplified and should be viewed as such.
/// For a more realistic example visit the `/examples` folder of this project.
